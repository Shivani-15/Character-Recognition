# Character-Recognition
Classifier for sequential data

### Datsset ###
This dataset consists of subset of  5 handwritten characters from Kannada/Telugu script. Each character is seen as sequence of 2-dimensional points (x and y coordinates) of one stroke of character (pen down to pen up).

### Problem Statement ###
To classify the characters
<br> <br>
**Model** : Since the characters are expressed as sequential coordinates, the problem statement requires a sequential model for classification. RNN and LSTM models are built and their performance is compared.
